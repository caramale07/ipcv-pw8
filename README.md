# PW8-Edge-Detection

## Overview
This project implements edge detection techniques using image processing methods. The goal is to detect and highlight edges in images using algorithms such as Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny edge detection.

## Features
- Implementation of different edge detection algorithms.
- Image preprocessing for better edge detection results.
- Visualization of detected edges using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the edge detection process.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
